# System Overview #
This project aims to create ‘ConnectHub’, a social networking website where users with similar interests can connect and collaborate. Using a client-server setup, users interact with a website to access features like messaging, interest-based groups, events, job listings, and resource centers. We will test the system using POSTMAN, a tool for efficient API testing, ensuring everything works correctly. Detailed responses will be analyzed to guarantee proper functionality, and automation features will be used to create tests that can be repeated. Additionally, we will test the website's performance under different loads to see how well it handles high traffic. Overall, this project aims to promote community engagement as every other platform and collaboration among users with various interests and backgrounds.
